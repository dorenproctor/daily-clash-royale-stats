This small project uses a python script to fetch stats about Clash Royale cards from [https://clashroyale.fandom.com](https://clashroyale.fandom.com) with BeatifulSoup. After scraping the stats, it turns it into JSON and stores it into a file called card_stats.json.

This script runs daily using GitHub Actions to maintain up-to-date data.
